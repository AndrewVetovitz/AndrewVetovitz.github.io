# About
I wanted to redo this website in order to fix the previous websites color schema. Also the fact that the old website
was not easy to update made it harder for future proofing.

# Tools
Built with [Angular 5](https://angular.io/) and github pages
[Boostrap 4 Beta 2](https://getbootstrap.com/) for UI design
[ngx-page-scroll](https://github.com/Nolanus/ngx-page-scroll) for scrolling functionality

# CDN's
Uses Cloudinary CDN to host the images
Google Fonts CDN for some of the fonts
Hosted on github pages
Formspree for the form submissions

# Todo
Add website caching in the future
Dynamically sized images
