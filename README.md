Personal website created with angular 5.

# About
I wanted to redo this website in order to fix the previous websites color schema. Also the fact that the website was not
easily updatable made this project a necessity.

# CDN's
Uses Cloudinary CDN to host the images
Google Fonts CDN for some of the fonts
Hosted on github pages
Formspree for the form submissions

# Todo
Add website caching in the future
Dynamically sized images
