# About
I wanted to redo this website in order to fix the previous websites color schema. Also the fact that the old website
was not easy to update made it harder for future proofing.

# Building
For server deployment run 'npm run prod' which will optimize the build bundle and add CNAME to the dist directory

# Tools
Built with [Angular 5](https://angular.io/) and github pages <br />
[Boostrap 4 Beta 2](https://getbootstrap.com/) for UI design <br />
[ngx-page-scroll](https://github.com/Nolanus/ngx-page-scroll) for scrolling functionality <br />

# CDN's
Uses Cloudinary CDN to host the images <br />
Google Fonts CDN for some of the fonts <br />
Hosted on github pages <br />
Formspree for the form submissions <br />

# Todo
Add website caching in the future <br />
Dynamically sized images <br />
